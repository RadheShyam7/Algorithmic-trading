# Stock Price Prediction and Feature Importance Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for a research project focused on predicting stock prices and understanding the importance of various features in financial data.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Predict stock price movements
2. Analyze feature importance in financial data
3. Explore the effectiveness of various technical indicators

## Key Components

- Data Collection: Automated system for collecting financial data from Finviz at 15-minute intervals
- Feature Importance Analysis: Implementation of multiple techniques including:
  - Permutation Importance
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boost
  - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Predictive Models:
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks
  - Decision Trees
- Technical Indicators:
  - VPT (Volume Price Trend)
  - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
